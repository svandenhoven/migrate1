# Global navigation file for GitLab Docs
#
# For each entry:
#
# - Do not start or end the URL with "/". Hugo renders all pages with a .html suffix.
# - URLs must be relative to root. For example, a page at https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/osx.html
#   has the entry `runner/install/osx.html`.
#
# For more information, see:

#
# Top-level titles:
#
# Top-level titles (e.g, "Install") are also used as options for filtering search results.
# If you add, edit, or remove a top-level title, you will need to also update
# the filters in search_filters.vue. You may want to get a frontend engineer to assist with this.
